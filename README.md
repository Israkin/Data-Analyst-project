# Data Transformation
First before the data transformation, Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib were imported and it was read from the csv file. After reading the CSV file, Data wrangling was done and I was able to extract some basic information from the dataset. I was able to deduce that there are some missing values in certain columns which needs to be thoroughly cleaned such as the imdb_id, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, genres, production_companies.
The next process is data cleaning, the first process of cleaning was done by dropping duplicates found in the dataset as well as finding and dropping irrelevant columns not useful for this analysis.
Data was explored and the questions asked were put to the test. The first question of “Which Genres are most popular from year to year” was first tackled, then the second question of “what kind of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues” was also tackled.
Bar charts and line charts as well as scattered plots were plotted where necessary.
